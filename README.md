# Conversion Calculator Using JavaScipt

### How does it work?
- It has four input/output fields, binary, Hexadecimal, Octa decimal and decimal.
- Calculator converts the selected input field into all remaining number systems.
- Before entering a number a given input field must be selected first and the remaining fields will act as an output once selected.
- When a desirable input field is selected then only the useful buttons will be enabled.
  - i.e. If binary is selected then all the number buttons are disabled other than 0 an 1 and for octa decimal only number 8 and 9 are disabled.
